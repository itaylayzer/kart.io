# 1. Reduce the Update Frequency
Instead of sending the kart’s position every frame (which could be up to 60 times per second), you can lower the update frequency to around 20-30 times per second. This is often sufficient for a smooth experience, and clients can interpolate between updates to maintain smooth visuals.

# 2. Use Delta Compression
Instead of sending the full position and orientation every update, send only the differences (deltas) from the last known state. This significantly reduces the size of each packet.

# 3. Position Compression
If you're currently using 64-bit floats for positions, quaternions, and velocities, consider using smaller data types:

Positions: Often, 16 or 32 bits are sufficient.
Quaternions/Rotations: Can be reduced to 24 or even 16 bits with careful quantization.
Velocities: Depending on your game’s needs, these can often be simplified too.
# 4. Dead Reckoning and Client-Side Prediction
Instead of sending precise positions constantly, the client can predict the kart’s position based on the last known velocity and orientation. The server then sends occasional corrections if the client drifts too far from the true position.

# 5. Event-Based Updates for State
You can also reduce updates by only sending state changes when necessary (e.g., collisions, changes in speed, significant turns).

# Conclusion
Your current approach is a good foundation, but by reducing update frequency, compressing data, and leveraging interpolation, you can further reduce bandwidth usage and eliminate glitches.
